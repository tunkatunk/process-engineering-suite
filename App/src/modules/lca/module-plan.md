Below is the ultimate prompt combining all provided details into a single, comprehensive, and actionable directive for developing the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) module using Python and PyQt. This prompt integrates the project context, tasks, code structure, initial code snippets, and key features derived from a thorough review of leading LCA software (SimaPro, GaBi, OpenLCA, EcoChain Mobius, and OneClick LCA) to ensure the software outperforms existing solutions and replaces the need for consultants.

Ultimate Prompt to Get Started on LCA Code

Objective:

You are tasked with developing the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) module for a cutting-edge LCA software using Python and PyQt for a desktop application. This software aims to be the best on the market, surpassing existing solutions like SimaPro, GaBi, OpenLCA, EcoChain Mobius, and OneClick LCA, and eliminating the need for LCA consultants by being comprehensive, intuitive, and powerful. The LCA module is the core of the application, encompassing the four stages of LCA: Goal and Scope Definition, Inventory Analysis, Impact Assessment, and Interpretation. This prompt provides a clear starting point for the LCA module within an established architecture, including foundational components and initial code, while laying the groundwork for advanced features.

Project Context:

Architecture: The software follows a modular design with a PyQt-based frontend (gui/), a Python-based backend (backend/), and utilities (utils/). The database uses SQLAlchemy with SQLite for local storage, with plans for future scalability (e.g., PostgreSQL or cloud-based deployment).
Existing Structure: Assumes prior implementation of user management and project management modules (e.g., gui/login.py, gui/dashboard.py, backend/models.py, backend/database.py).
Goal: Develop the LCA module incrementally, starting with Goal and Scope Definition and Inventory Analysis, then expanding to Impact Assessment and Interpretation, while ensuring modularity and extensibility for future enhancements.
Tasks for the LCA Module:

Setup the LCA Module Structure:
Create a subdirectory gui/lca/ for LCA-specific PyQt widgets and interfaces.
Update backend/models.py to include LCA-related data models (e.g., GoalScope, Process, Flow).
Ensure integration with existing project management (e.g., linking LCA data to a Project).
Goal and Scope Definition:
Design a PyQt interface (gui/lca/goal_scope.py) with interactive forms for defining the LCA goal, functional unit, system boundaries, and assumptions, including tooltips and predefined templates for common product types (e.g., electronics, packaging).
Implement a backend model (backend/models.py) and controller (backend/controllers/lca_controller.py) to save and retrieve this data.
Inventory Analysis (Initial Version):
Create an interface (gui/lca/inventory.py) with a process library and a drag-and-drop area to build product systems, featuring a basic library of predefined processes (e.g., "Steel Production", "Transport by Truck").
Define backend models for Process and Flow, and implement basic data input for process inputs/outputs, saving to the database.
Database Integration:
Extend the SQLite database schema to support LCA data, ensuring relationships between projects, processes, and flows.
Use SQLAlchemy for ORM to manage data persistence.
Initial Code Kickoff:
Provide starter code for the above components, adhering to best practices (modularity, documentation, error handling).

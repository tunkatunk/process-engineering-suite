# Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) Module - User Guide

## Overview

The Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) module helps you evaluate the environmental impact of a product or process across its life cycle stages. It calculates impacts in terms of:

- CO2 emissions (kg)
- Water usage (L)
- Energy consumption (kWh)

## Getting Started

1. Open the application and select the "Life Cycle Analysis" tab.
2. Enter information about each life cycle stage and its activities.
3. Calculate and view the environmental impacts.
4. Export results for reporting or further analysis.

## Input Form

### Stage Details

1. **Stage Name**: Enter a name for the life cycle stage (e.g., "Raw Material Extraction", "Manufacturing", "Transportation", "Use", "End of Life").

2. **Activities**: For each activity in the stage:
   - Select an activity from the dropdown menu
   - Enter the quantity (e.g., kWh of electricity, kg of material)
   - Use the "Add Activity" button to add more activities
   - Use the "Remove" button to remove unwanted activities

### Calculation

1. Click the "Calculate" button to process the inputs and calculate environmental impacts.
2. The results will appear in the "Results" tab.

## Results

The Results tab displays:

1. **Impact Summary Table**: Shows the total CO2 emissions, water usage, and energy consumption.

2. **Charts**: Visual representation of the environmental impacts:
   - Pie chart showing the relative distribution of impacts

## Exporting Results

1. Click the "Export" button in the Results tab.
2. Choose a file format (CSV or Excel).
3. Select a location to save the file.
4. The exported file will contain all the tabulated results.

## Tips for Accurate Analysis

1. **Comprehensive Inclusion**: Include all significant activities in each life cycle stage.
2. **Consistent Units**: Ensure quantities are entered in the correct units.
3. **Data Quality**: Use the most accurate data available for activities.
4. **System Boundaries**: Clearly define what's included and excluded in your analysis.

## Predefined Activities

The module includes predefined impact factors for common activities:

- Electricity generation (coal, natural gas, solar, wind)
- Transportation (truck, ship, rail)
- Materials (steel, aluminum, plastic, glass, concrete, paper)
- Waste treatment (landfill, recycling, incineration)
